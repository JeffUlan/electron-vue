# Building your app

electron-vue supports both [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) and [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to package and distribute your production ready apps. Both packagers are backed by the amazing [electron-userland](https://github.com/electron-userland) community and each have detailed documentation. During `vue-cli` scaffolding you will be asked which packager you will want to use.

## [electron-packager](using-electron-packager.md)
