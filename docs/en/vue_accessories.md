# Vue Accessories

### Ready to use vue plugins

electron-vue comes packed with the following vue plugins that can be installed during `vue-cli` scaffolding...

* [vue-electron](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/vue-electron) \(attach electron APIs to Vue object\)
* [vue-resource](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource) \(web requests\)
* [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) \(single page application routes\)
* [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) \(flux-inspired application architecture\)

### NPM scripts

**Both `npm run vue:route` & `npm run vuex:module` are no longer supported in `electron-vue` and have been removed.** 

Documentation about these previous scripts can be found in an earlier version of this page, found [here](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue/blob/d7adb78b10a314a13b7d087eb3091e0b208f3b48/docs/vue_accessories.md).
