# Contributing
Wanting to help with this boilerplate? Feel free to submit a pull request. Before getting ready to submit anything, make sure to check out the following...

### JavaScript Standard Style
To ensure all JS follows basic ***style standards*** make sure it follows these [rules](http://standardjs.com/#rules).

### `npm install`
As noted in the [**Getting Started**](getting_started.md) section, after running `npm install` a `postinstall` script will then remove the entire `.git` directory. Be sure to remove that `postinstall` script from the `package.json` temporarily. 

### TODOs
When working on a specific TODO from the documentation, be sure to include that in the pull request title / commit message and update the TODO list as well. 

### Commits
Please keep commits to a minimum. There's no need to submit a pull request with let's say 10+ commits when they could be squashed. I'm sure you can relate **¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**.

Also, please leave a comment on the pull request detailing what changes are being proposed (You could get away with this one though). Thanks.
