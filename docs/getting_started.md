# Getting Started
**NOTICE**

 electron-vue was built using node `v5.10.0`. You can check your node version by running `node -v`. If you need to change your node version, then I'd recommend using [creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.markdown).

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue
cd electron-vue
npm i
```

## Starting the app
```bash
npm run dev
```
...and boom! You now have a running electron-vue app.
